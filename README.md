# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic Retinopathy, or DR, is a condition where the small blood vessels of the retina
on being damaged, result in leakage of the fluid into the retina, and in the process
damaging it. Prolonged diabetes can cause extreme cases of Diabetic Retinopathy,
which leads to total blindness. Thus, detection of DR at an early age is necessary.
We have developed an automated system which will classify an eye image as being

normal or having mild, moderate, severe or proliferative DR using a convolutional neu-
ral network. The pre-processing techniques used with a convolutional neural net play

a vital role in achieving better performance. To study and assess the effects of various
pre-processing techniques, including illumination correction and contrast enhancement

on eye fundus image quality, we have performed a comparative analysis. We imple-
mented a few pre-processing techniques on colour retinal images to find out the best

method for most efficient image enhancement. These techniques have been tested on
over 10,000 images obtained from Kaggleâ€™s data repository.

The statistical evaluation of the various pre-processing techniques was done by as-
sessing the performance of the complete model. We plotted Receiver Operating Char-
acteristic (ROC) curves to compare the measure of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.
